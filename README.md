TTT is a mafia-esque multiplayer game created using s&box. It's aimed to be the spiritual successor of [TTT](https://ttt.badking.net/) but developed for [s&box](https://sbox.facepunch.com/news). The goal of this project is to replicate the vanilla TTT experience with some quality of life thrown in.

## Special Thanks
[Thanks to Bad King Urgrain for creating "Trouble in Terrorist Town"](https://ttt.badking.net/) for [Garry's Mod](https://gmod.facepunch.com/) for which sbox-TTT takes inspiration from.

This repo is a fork of [CigarLounge's repository](https://github.com/CigarLounge/sbox-TTT), aimed to improve the base game and add missing content.
Thanks to CigarLounge's team which created the VAST majority of this, you can checkout their [devblog update videos on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCk2IAm1j9o_3GWrqf537gNg), as well as [their website](https://cigarlounge.github.io/) that showcases some gameplay & screenshots.
